# Odin-Recipes
In the Odin Recipes project, I built a simple recipe website using HTML tags like &lt;h1> to &lt;h6>, &lt;p>, &lt;a>, &lt;img>, and lists (&lt;ul>, &lt;ol>). I added basic CSS styling, including font-size, font-style, color, and background-color. This project enhanced my HTML and CSS skills.
