  - Paragraphs (`<p>`) for detailed text.  
  - Links (`<a>`) to navigate between pages.  
  - Images (`<img>`) to display visuals of recipes.  
  - Unordered (`<ul>`) and ordered lists (`<ol>`) to structure recipe steps and ingredients.  

- **CSS Styling:**  
  - Font properties: `font-size`, `font-style`, and `color`.  
  - Background customization with `background-color`.  
  - Improved visual appeal with basic design techniques.
